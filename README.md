## Background

- Tool was originally for personal use.
- Came from a need to more easily sort through the endless typefaces on my computer and those on the internet.
- My previous workflow of creating multiple text boxes in Illustrator and sampling different fonts was getting harder and harder as I collected more fonts.
- So I created a tool that allows me to sample all the typefaces on my computer and some in select web repositories.
- Now I can create multiple projects, and save those typefaces to those projects so i can go back to them later. I can also tag them with visual keywords to make future hunts more seemless.
