## Project Write Up.

### The Problem
-	I like fonts. I like fonts a lot. I might even go as far as calling it an obsession. While I’m not usually one to hoard things, fonts bring about an exception to this where I have found myself with a massive font library collected from every open-source and free-trial font I could find on the internet.
-	For the record, I don’t consider this obsession the problem, it’s more what comes next: how can I more easily sort through this massive library, and how can I sample more fonts for every projects without creative a few dozen text boxes in illustrator (which is an unreasonably tedious process with Adobe).

### My Process
-	Design: The process began when I started talking to designers and type enthusiasts (my favorite demographic) about the problem.  I interviewed old classmates, friends, and creatives in my share studio to develop personas. Then I went through the typical design cycle: I finalized brand values and visual keywords, ideated, then created moodboards, sketches, and wireframes before finalizing a design.  
-	Technology: I did the project in three iterations: the first one was a dev exploration to prove to myself I could do it, the second considered different potential technologies and weighed their benefits, and the third was more considered and planned – following a Trello board with predetermined user stories and a more refined process to add new features. 

## My Solution
-	I landed on a logo that obscures between a rolodex (to symbolize a filing system) and an asterisk (to symbolize marking an item of interest), then combined that with a semi geometric sans typeface (to symbolize structure and organization) that has the illusion of splitting apart (to symbolize deep inspection of a collection). 
-	I then built a web app that allows users to see all the typefaces they have installed on their computers in one place with whatever text they chose, to add them to projects, to mark them as favorites, and to add adjectives to describe them. 
-	I gave the app the overall feel of a high-end type foundry for familiarity and ensured that the samples were unobscured by making links appear only on hover.
-	The app was built on a MERN stack for the single page user experience. I then added a Chrome extension to populate a list of user-installed fonts (this was the biggest technical challenge, as Javascript prevents command line queries). 

## Features

### Current

The tool currently allows users to see all the typefaces they have installed on their computers, to sample them with a text of their choice, and to save those they wish to their favorites collection.

### Upcoming

- The ability to create "projects" and save typefaces to them as you see fit.
- The ability to search for typefaces / refine the list by name.
- The ability to add adjectives to different typefaces so as to better sort through them.
- The ability to filter by these adjectives.

## Technologies Used
- Mongoose / MongoDB to store user and nomination data.
- Express / Node for the backend.
- React for the front end.
- Deployed and hosted using Heroku.
